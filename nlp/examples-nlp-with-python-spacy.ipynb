    "## The challenge: predict the next Michelin star\n",
    "\n",
    "Thanks to [the people at analyticslab.nl](https://www.theanalyticslab.nl/about-us/) we will use a restaurant review dataset with nearly 370.000 reviews collected over an eight-year period. Using the dataset which they have scraped, we will follow along [their blogpost series](https://www.theanalyticslab.nl/nlpblogs_0_preparing_restaurant_review_data_for_nlp_and_predictive_modeling/), but replacing their R code with a workflow in Python spaCy.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we compare different NLP techniques to show you how we get valuable information from unstructured text. Given the restaurant reviews, the challenge is whether 'the wisdom of the croud' - reviews from restaurant visitors - could be used to predict which restaurants are most likely to receive a new Michelin-star. We will try to see how that worked out. To following tools and techniques will be demonstrated:\n",
    "\n",
    "- How to setup a reproducible text pipeline in Python spaCy for text analysis;\n",
    "- How to apply [topic modeling](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~blei/papers/Blei2012.pdf) as the primary tool to extract information from the review texts, to be combined and used in predictive modeling techniques to end up with our predictions.\n",
    "- How two more novel NLP techniques cabn \n",
    " To answer these questions, we will explain our approach in more detail in the coming articles. But we didn't stop exploring NLP techniques after our publication, and we also like to share insights from adding more novel NLP techniques. More specifically we will use two types of word embeddings - a classic [Word2Vec model](https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3781) and a GLoVe embedding model - we'll use transfer learning with pretrained word embeddings and we use BERT. We compare the added value of these advanced NLP techniques to our baseline topic model on the same dataset. By showing what we did and how we did it, we hope to guide others that are keen to use textual data for their own data science endeavours.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data preparation\n",
    "Before we delve into the analytical side of things, we need some prepared textual data. As all true data scientists know, proper data preparation takes most of your time and is most decisive for the quality of the analysis results you end up with. Since preparing textual data is another cup of tea compared to preparing structured numeric or categorical data, and our goal is to show you how to do text analytics, we also want to show you how we cleaned and prepared the data we gathered. Therefore, in this notebook we start with the data dump with all reviews and explore and prepare this data in a number of steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://bhciaaablob.blob.core.windows.net/thefork/Text%20preprocessing%20pipeline_noheader.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result of these steps, we end up with - aside from building insights in our data and some cleaning - a number of flat files we can use as source files throughout the rest of the articles:\n",
    "\n",
    "- __reviews.csv__: a csv file with review texts (original and cleaned) - the fuel for our NLP analyses. (included key: restoreviewid, hence the unique identifier for a review)\n",
    "- __labels.csv__: a csv file with 1 / 0 values, indicating whether the review is a review for a Michelin restaurant or not (included key: restoreviewid)\n",
    "- __restoid.csv__: a csv file with restaurant id's, to be able to determine which reviews belong to which restaurant (included key: restoreviewid)\n",
    "- __trainids.csv__: a csv file with 1 / 0 values, indicating whether the review should be used for training or testing - we already split the reviews in train/test to enable reuse of the same samples for fair comparisons between techniques (included key: restoreviewid)\n",
    "- __features.csv__: a csv file with other features regarding the reviews (included key: restoreviewid)\n",
    "\n",
    "These files with the cleaned and relevant data for NLP techniques are made available to you via public blob storage so that you can run all code we present yourself and see how things work in more detail."

    "First of all, the available texts are all encapsulated in \"b'...''\", indicating the texts are byte literals. Also you might spot some strange sequences of tokens like in 'ingredi\\xc3\\xabnten', indicating that our texts include UTF-8 encoded tokens (here, the character ë that has the code \\xc3\\xab in UTF-8). This combination of byte literal encapsulation with the UTF-8 codes shows that in the creation of the source data we have available, the encoding got messed up a bit, making it difficult to to obtain the review texts out of the encoded data. We won't go in to too much detail here (if you want, read [this](https://diveintopython3.net/strings.html)) but you might run into similar stuff when you start working with textual data. In short, there are different encoding types and you need to know what you are working with. We need to make sure we use the right encoding and we should get rid of the \"b'...''\" in the strings.\n",

    "We could spend some time on figuring out how to correct this messing-up due to coding as good as possible. However, in order not to lose too much time and effort on undoing this (and we don't) we can take a short cut with minimal loss of data by cleaning the texts with some regular expressions. Depending on your goal, you might want to go the extra mile and try to restore the texts in their original UTF-8 encoding though! As so often in data science projects, we're struggling with available time and resources: You need to pick you battles - and pick them wisely!\n",

    "When you call `nlp` on a text, spaCy first tokenizes the text to produce a `Doc` object. The `Doc` is then processed in several different steps – this is also referred to as the __processing pipeline__. The pipeline used by the [trained pipelines](https://spacy.io/models) typically include a tagger, a lemmatizer, a parser and an entity recognizer. Each pipeline component returns the processed `Doc`, which is then passed on to the next component.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tokenizer is a “special” component and isn’t part of the regular pipeline. It also doesn’t show up in `nlp.pipe_names`. The reason is that there can only really be one tokenizer, and while all other pipeline components take a `Doc` and return it, the tokenizer takes a __string of text__ and turns it into a `Doc`. You can still customize the tokenizer, though. `nlp.tokenizer` is writable, so you can either create your own [`Tokenizer` class from scratch](https://spacy.io/usage/linguistic-features#native-tokenizers), or even replace it with an [entirely custom function](https://spacy.io/usage/linguistic-features#custom-tokenizer).\n",
